THE LEAK OBSERVED ON THAT DATE WAS BELOW THE REPORTING THRESHOLD.  A POST DISCOVERY INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THAT THE GRAVITOMETER, WHICH HAD NOT BEEN USED SINCE THE EARLY 1970'S, WAS THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK.  MECHANICAL STRESSES OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME CAUSED THE BOLTS INSIDE THE GRAVITOMETER TO COME LOOSE RESULTING IN THE GRAVITOMETER SAMPLE PROBE BASE TO TILT TO THE SIDE.  THIS TILTING ALLOWED REFINED PRODUCTS TO BYPASS THE GRAVITOMETER INTERNAL O-RING AND ENTER THE GRAVITOMETER ELECTRICAL ENCLOSURE THAT WAS NOT DESIGNED TO HOLD PIPELINE PRESSURES.  REFINED PRODUCT LEAKED FROM THE THREADED CONNECTIONS   ON THE ELECTRICAL PORTION OF THE GRAVITOMETER INTO THE VAULT.  WOLVERINE HAS REMOVED THE GRAVITOMETER AND INSTALLED A BLIND FLANGE."

PENETRATORS TYPICALLY ARE VERY NARROW AND BECAUSE OF REINFORCEMENT FROM SURROUNDING SOUND METAL, MAY WITHSTAND RELATIVELY HIGH PRESSURE WITHOUT LEAKING. OVER TIME, HOWEVER, THE SLAG BECOMES DISLODGED AND THE WELD LEAKS. ONCE A LEAK DEVELOPS, IT TENDS TO ENLARGE WITH TIME. BECAUSE THEY ARE RELATIVELY SMALL, PENETRATORS THAT BECOME ENLARGED IN SERVICE NORMALLY CAUSE LEAKS RATHER THAN RUPTURES.    THE SURFACE ANOMALIES WERE SHALLOW SLIVERS, WHICH ARE SMALL PIECES OF METAL ROLLED INTO THE SURFACE BUT ATTACHED ONLY ONE END. SLIVERS ARE CAUSED BY INADEQUATE CONDITIONING OF SEMI-FINISHED PRODUCTS THAT ARE NOT OPEN TO THE SURFACE BECOME FUSED DURING HOT ROLLING."
